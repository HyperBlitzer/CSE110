# Introduction to Who I Am ðŸ’€

My name is Jose Arreguin and I am a Math-CS major at Muir and I am graduating in the year 2025

### CSE classes I have taken at UCSD:
- CSE 11 - **Accelerated Intro to Programming**
- CSE 12 - **Basic Data Structures**
- CSE 15L - **Software Tools and Techniques Lab**
- CSE 20 - **Discrete Mathematics**
- CSE 21 - **Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems**
- CSE 30 - **Computer Organization and Systems Programming**
- CSE 100R - **Advanced Data Structures**

This quarter, _Spring 2023_, I have started to learn how create games in Unity with C# since I like playing video games and want to really understand the complexities of creating games.

> Although it is nothing special, I have modified a flappy bird-esque type of game from a tutorial which can be downloaded with this link... [Download Pipe Jumper\(From Repo\)](Pipe_Jumper.exe)

Some of the things that I still want to add to the game are

- [ ] Highscore system
- [ ] Wing animation
- [ ] Adding different kinds of pipes (like vertically moving pipes)

An example of some code to move a 2D object up in Unity would be
```
if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) && isAlive) {
    myRigidBody.velocity = Vector2.up * flapStrength;
}
```

1. **Root** ![RootImage](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JUAUWaVUzeBgzirhZNmHHw__opengraph/img/lnl-mnvbEge_7gtTD-sCxoI5NhY=/0x170:2048x1245/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc()/pic4254509.jpg)
