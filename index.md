This quarter, _Spring 2023_, I have started to learn how create games in Unity with C# since I like playing video games and want to really understand the complexities of creating games.

Although it is nothing special, I have modified a flappy bird-esque type of game from a tutorial which can be downloaded with this link... [Download Pipe Jumper](Pipe_Jumper.exe)

- Screenshots of the game

Another thing I enjoy doing is playing board games, either with friends or with strangers

I like board games, video games, and I have traveled.
